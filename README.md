## Overview

This project involves the conversion of standard medical radiographs (X-rays) into 3D-printable models that allow for tactile exploration of anatomical structures. The aim is to create accessible, hands-on teaching aids for use in educational settings, particularly where conventional imaging technology may not be available.

---

## Key Features

- Converts 2D radiographic images (e.g., hands, teeth, joints) into 3D-printable STL files  
- Designed for tactile use by students, educators, and visually impaired users  
- Enhances understanding of anatomical features and clinical conditions through physical interaction  
- Ideal for classroom demonstrations, public science outreach, and informal learning environments  

---

## Use Cases

- Anatomy and health science education  
- Outreach events and exhibitions  
- Inclusive learning for visually impaired or neurodiverse students  
- Medical communication and patient education

## Getting Started

1. Open the STL or 3MF files in your preferred 3D printing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer, Bambu Slicer).
2. For best results (that mimic real X-rays), use [eSun Cold White PLA+](https://www.amazon.co.uk/eSUN-Filament-Material-Dimensional-Refills%EF%BC%8CBlack/dp/B07FQ98RNP).
3. Printer settings:
   - **Nozzle:** 0.4 mm  
   - **Layer Height:** 0.20  
   - **Wall Loops:** 2  
   - **Infill Density:** 15%  
   - **Brim:** Outer Brim  
   - **Brim Width:** 15 mm  
4. Shine a bright light behind the print to get the full X-ray effect.  
5. Use printed models in lessons, outreach, or personal study.

## Requirements

- Basic familiarity with 3D printing workflows  
- 3D printer (FDM recommended for affordability)
